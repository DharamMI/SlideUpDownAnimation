# SlideUpDownAnimation

SlideUpDown Animation is the coolest way to showcase in an application! This Animation animates the using the pan gesture shows a two image on top of each other which is been masked! You can drag the DragCursor up and down and it will show Your the both image alternatively! Depends on the postion of DragCursor!

The Coolest Part is, If you drag the cursor on top side it will show you an animation "Disliked" will Appear from center and vanishes after few Seconds and if you drag the cursor at the bottom it will show you "Liked" and "Matched" like a dating app have! You can also use it on other apps Depends on where you want to apply it!
